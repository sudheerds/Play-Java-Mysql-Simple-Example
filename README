This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

To be able to use mysql database with your play-java application we need to make the following simple changes to 
some files:

1. Edit Build.sbt file to include mysql jdbc driver, just replace this with the already existing libraryDependecies:

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  javaJdbc,
  cache,
  javaWs,
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.36"
)

also add Ebean by replacing root val with the following in the same file:

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
 .enablePlugins(PlayJava,PlayEbean)
 
 2. Edit the Plugins.sbt file to enable the ebean plugin
 just uncomment the following line int the file:
 
 addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-play-ebean" % "1.0.0")
 
 3. Edit the application.conf file to point your model classes to ebean
 just add the following:
 
 ebean.default = "models.*"
 
 Its always a good practice to have a separate folder for all you model classes. So, having controllers, 
 models and views in the app folder is a great categorization.
 
 Now, the important db configuration, stay in the same file and find lines starting with db, uncomment and edit
 appropriately:
 
db.default.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
db.default.url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-database-name"
db.default.username=user who created the database or has access to
db.default.password="password within these quotes"

That's it, your application is noe set to go real time. No more configurations required.

Hope you find this helpful.

ps: all the configurations are present in my files, but you have to customize to suit you db names.
